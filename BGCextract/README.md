Due to the large biosynthetic potential within Salinispora, we concentrated on understanding the evolutionary processes governing BGC distribution by concentrating on 9 well-characterized molecules. These molecules have been linked to their BGC with biosynthetic pathways previously proposed in the literature.

# Analysis of 9 well-characterized molecules

We selected a range of molecules spanning biosynthetic classes (e.g., NRPS, PKS) and phylgoenetic conservatism, ranging from species-specific to highly-conserved BGCs across species.

* Lymphostin (all 9 species)
* Salinipostins (7 species)
* Salinosporamide (6 species)
* Lomaiviticin (6 species)
* Staurosporine (4 species)
* Salinilactam (3 species)
* Salinichelins (2 species)
* Sporolide (2 species)
* Rifamycin (1 species)

Briefly, we used the network generated by [BiG-SCAPE](../bigscape-network) to find gene cluster families (GCFs) in the network containing the known MIBIG reference BGC for the 9 molecules. Due to BiG-SCAPE finely splitting known molecuels into multiple GCFs (i.e., lomaiviticins), entire BGC community modules were extracted from the network. Each BGC in the module was screened for the correct gene order and presence of 2 core biosynthetic genes (e.g., lymA and lymB in sequential order in the lymphostin module).
